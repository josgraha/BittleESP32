/* Customized note and melody player for OpenCat, and MEOW \(=^_^=)/
   It also serves to test the baud rate of the serial moniter and the crystal frequency.
   OpenCat happens to use 57600 baud rate (and a 20MHz crystal on Petoi's dedicated PCB).
   If you cannot see this sentence on serial monitor,
      there's something wrong with your Arduino IDE's configuration.

   The beep() is better if played with a passive buzzer
   The meow() can only be played with an active buzzer on PWM pins
   On most Arduino, the PWM pins are identified with a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.
   If your buzzer cannot meow(), it's probably a passive buzzer.
